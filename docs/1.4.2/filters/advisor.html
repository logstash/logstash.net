<h3>Milestone: <a href="../plugin-milestones">1</a></h3>
<div class="community-plugin-notice">
  <strong>This is a community-contributed plugin!</strong> It does not ship with logstash by default, but it is easy to install!
  To use this, you must have <a href="../contrib-plugins">installed the contrib plugins package</a>.
</div>

<p>INFORMATION:
The filter Advisor is designed for capture and confrontation the events. 
The events must be grep by a filter first, then it can pull out a copy of it, like clone, whit tags &#8220;advisor_first&#8221;,
this copy is the first occurrence of this event verified in time_adv.
After time_adv Advisor will pull out an event tagged &#8220;advisor_info&#8221; who will tell you the number of same events verified in time_adv.
INFORMATION ABOUT CLASS:
For do this job, i used a thread that will sleep time adv. I assume that events coming on advisor are tagged, then i use an array for storing different events.
If an events is not present on array, then is the first and if the option is activate then  advisor push out a copy of event.
Else if the event is present on array, then is another same event and not the first, let&#8217;s count it.<br />
USAGE:
This is an example of logstash config:
filter{
 advisor {
    time_adv =&gt; 1                     #(optional)
    send_first =&gt; true                #(optional)
 }
}
We analize this:
time_adv =&gt; 1
Means the time when the events matched and collected are pushed on outputs with tag &#8220;advisor_info&#8221;.
send_first =&gt; true
Means you can push out the first events different who came in advisor like clone copy and tagged with &#8220;advisor_first&#8221;</p>


<h3> Synopsis </h3>

This is what it might look like in your config file:

<pre><code>filter {
  advisor {
    <a href="#add_field">add_field</a> => ... # hash (optional), default: {}
    <a href="#add_tag">add_tag</a> => ... # array (optional), default: []
    <a href="#remove_field">remove_field</a> => ... # array (optional), default: []
    <a href="#remove_tag">remove_tag</a> => ... # array (optional), default: []
    <a href="#send_first">send_first</a> => ... # boolean (optional), default: true
    <a href="#time_adv">time_adv</a> => ... # number (optional), default: 0
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3> Details </h3>

<h4> 
  <a name="add_field">
    add_field
    
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is <a href="../configuration#hash">hash</a> </li>
  <li> Default value is {} </li>
</ul>

<p>If this filter is successful, add any arbitrary fields to this event.
Field names can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the %{field}
Example:</p>

<pre><code>filter {
  advisor {
    add_field =&gt; { "foo_%{somefield}" =&gt; "Hello world, from %{host}" }
  }
}

# You can also add multiple fields at once:

filter {
  advisor {
    add_field =&gt; { 
      "foo_%{somefield}" =&gt; "Hello world, from %{host}"
      "new_field" =&gt; "new_static_value"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the event has field &#8220;somefield&#8221; == &#8220;hello&#8221; this filter, on success,
would add field &#8220;foo_hello&#8221; if it is present, with the
value above and the %{host} piece replaced with that value from the
event. The second example would also add a hardcoded field. </p>


<h4> 
  <a name="add_tag">
    add_tag
    
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is <a href="../configuration#array">array</a> </li>
  <li> Default value is [] </li>
</ul>

<p>If this filter is successful, add arbitrary tags to the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the %{field}
syntax. Example:</p>

<pre><code>filter {
  advisor {
    add_tag =&gt; [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
  }
}

# You can also add multiple tags at once:
filter {
  advisor {
    add_tag =&gt; [ "foo_%{somefield}", "taggedy_tag"]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the event has field &#8220;somefield&#8221; == &#8220;hello&#8221; this filter, on success,
would add a tag &#8220;foo_hello&#8221; (and the second example would of course add a &#8220;taggedy_tag&#8221; tag).</p>


<h4> 
  <a name="exclude_tags">
    exclude_tags
     <strong>DEPRECATED</strong>
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> DEPRECATED WARNING: This config item is deprecated. It may be removed in a further version. </li>
  <li> Value type is <a href="../configuration#array">array</a> </li>
  <li> Default value is [] </li>
</ul>

<p>Only handle events without all/any (controlled by exclude_any config
option) of these tags.
Optional.</p>


<h4> 
  <a name="remove_field">
    remove_field
    
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is <a href="../configuration#array">array</a> </li>
  <li> Default value is [] </li>
</ul>

<p>If this filter is successful, remove arbitrary fields from this event.
Fields names can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the %{field}
Example:</p>

<pre><code>filter {
  advisor {
    remove_field =&gt; [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
  }
}

# You can also remove multiple fields at once:

filter {
  advisor {
    remove_field =&gt; [ "foo_%{somefield}" "my_extraneous_field" ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the event has field &#8220;somefield&#8221; == &#8220;hello&#8221; this filter, on success,
would remove the field with name &#8220;foo_hello&#8221; if it is present. The second 
example would remove an additional, non-dynamic field.</p>


<h4> 
  <a name="remove_tag">
    remove_tag
    
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is <a href="../configuration#array">array</a> </li>
  <li> Default value is [] </li>
</ul>

<p>If this filter is successful, remove arbitrary tags from the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the %{field}
syntax. Example:</p>

<pre><code>filter {
  advisor {
    remove_tag =&gt; [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
  }
}

# You can also remove multiple tags at once:

filter {
  advisor {
    remove_tag =&gt; [ "foo_%{somefield}", "sad_unwanted_tag"]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the event has field &#8220;somefield&#8221; == &#8220;hello&#8221; this filter, on success,
would remove the tag &#8220;foo_hello&#8221; if it is present. The second example
would remove a sad, unwanted tag as well. </p>


<h4> 
  <a name="send_first">
    send_first
    
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is <a href="../configuration#boolean">boolean</a> </li>
  <li> Default value is true </li>
</ul>

<p>If you want the first different event will be pushed out like a copy</p>


<h4> 
  <a name="tags">
    tags
     <strong>DEPRECATED</strong>

<ul>
  <li> DEPRECATED WARNING: This config item is deprecated. It may be removed in a further version. </li>
  <li> Value type is <a href="../configuration#array">array</a> </li>
  <li> Default value is [] </li>
