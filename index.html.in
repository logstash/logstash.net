<div class="featured_text">
  <p>logstash is a tool for managing events and logs. You can use it to collect
  logs, parse them, and store them for later use (like, for searching).
  Speaking of searching, logstash comes with a web interface for searching and
  drilling into all of your logs.</p>

  <p>It is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache 2.0, meaning
  you are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.</p>

  <p>logstash is now a part of the <a href="http://elasticsearch.org">Elasticsearch</a> family! This allows us to build better software much faster as well as offering <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.com/support/">production support</a></p>

<h2>Ship logs from any source, parse them, get the right timestamp, index them,
  and search them.</h2>
<div class="sub_content_text">

  <p>All your logs from all over your infrastructure in one place - with
  searching and graphing. Since we can easily parse text-based logs, you can
  query for more precise things like, all 404 http errors, nagios critical alerts
  in hard state, or mail server faults - all without accidentally finding logs
  with the word &lsquo;404&rsquo; or &lsquo;critical&rsquo; in the wrong place.
